                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>I am Matthew Flammia, a computer science major interested mostly in hardware and networking. I first began understanding networking in middle school with trying to run Minecraft servers for friends, and now I am still running Minecraft servers for friends... but that experience is what lead me to make it my passion.</p>

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>I had graduated from high school in 2017, and in senior year alone had worked on the entire process of the yearbook, was president of the robotics club, and was the schools photographer. I also lead many events that the school hosted. For college I started my degree as a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, but in my senior year, COVID had began, and taking classes became much more difficult. I had made the decision to change to a Bachelor of Arts  in Computer Science instead, allowing me to graduate a semester earlier.</p>

                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>I started working at a young age at the same store my Father worked at, and eventually began working other jobs during high school. I first began doing clerical work at a car dealership as a summer job. Later when summer ended, I began working at Staples. Soon that business had shutdown, so I moved on to work at another dealership doing clerical work. My manager had known of my computer knowledge, and had me be in charge of the database of the scanned documents of the office. Soon I began doing IT, the database, and helping with accounting as well. As of October 22, 2021 I still work here.</p>
